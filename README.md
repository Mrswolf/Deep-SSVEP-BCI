# Deep-SSVEP-BCI
This is the official repository for deep learning networks described in paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/ 
This repository alows you to train and test models to replicate the results

# Requisites

All models were implemented tested with MATLAB 2018B. All following steps assume that they are executed under these conditions.

# Preparation
First we have to download all datasets.
The Benchmark dataset and BETA dataset can be downloaded from http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.



# Training and evaluating the models

# Hyperparameters
