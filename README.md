# A Deep Neural Network for SSVEP-based Brain Computer Interfaces
This is the official repository for deep learning networks described in paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/ 
This repository alows you to train and test models to replicate the results

|*Proposed deep learning model architecture. It is drawn for input signal that has 50 time samples from 9 channels and is filtered with 3 bandpass filters. When input size or utilized number of bandpass filters change, corresponding kernels' sizes change accordingly.*|


# Requisites

All models were implemented tested with MATLAB 2018B. All following steps assume that they are executed under these conditions.

# Preparation
First we have to download all datasets.
The Benchmark dataset and BETA dataset can be downloaded from http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.



# Training and evaluating the models

# Hyperparameters
